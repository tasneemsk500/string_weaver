Creating a new String value

Challenge:
Create a function named stringWeaver that takes two strings and returns a new string where:

1) Ignore numbers as if they don't exists. Remove all of the numbers from both strings first. Characters from both strings alternate (first char from first string, first char from second string, second char from first string, etc.)
2) If one string is longer than the other, add the remaining characters at the end
3) Convert all vowels to uppercase
4) Return the final string
